# SkillUpgrade-Projects2
# Interactive Sign-Up Form

This project is a simple, interactive sign-up form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes fields for a username, email, and password, and performs client-side validation to ensure user input meets the required criteria.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- *Task2.html*: The main HTML file that structures the webpage and form.
- *style2.css*: The CSS file that styles the form and ensures it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- *script.js*: The JavaScript file that handles form validation and user interaction.

## Features

- *Form Fields*: 
  - *Username*: Must be at least 3 characters long.
  - *Email*: Must be a valid email format.
  - *Password*: Must be at least 6 characters long.
- *Validation*: The form performs real-time validation and displays error messages if the inputs do not meet the specified criteria.
- *User Feedback*: The form provides instant feedback on submission. If all inputs are valid, a success message is displayed; otherwise, relevant error messages are shown.
- *Responsive Design*: The form is styled to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## How to Use

1. *Clone or Download*: Clone this repository or download the files.
2. *Open the File*: Open the index.html file in a web browser to view and interact with the form.
3. *Modify the Code*: Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to suit your needs.

## Form Validation

The form validation is handled by the script.js file, which includes:

- *Username Validation*: Ensures the username is at least 3 characters long.
- *Email Validation*: Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- *Password Validation*: Ensures the password is at least 6 characters long.

If any validation fails, an error message is displayed next to the relevant field, and the form is not submitted.

## Customization

You can easily customize the form by:

- *Modifying Styles*: Update the style2.css file to change the appearance of the form.
- *Extending Validation*: Add more validation rules in the script.js file for additional fields or more complex requirements.
- *Enhancing Interactivity*: Use JavaScript to add more interactive features, such as password strength indicators, tooltips, or dynamic form fields.
